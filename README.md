# MCET-101-Project-2-Smart-Greenhouse

Introduction
In a world where food security and sustainability matter more than ever, a smart greenhouse is
more than a hobby — it’s a step toward precision cultivation. Using Arduino and a suite of sensors,
we’re automating plant care so you can focus on growth, not guesswork.
Your team has been contracted to design a smart greenhouse control system that monitors
environmental conditions and automatically responds to maintain optimal plant growth. This
system simulates real-world applications in urban agriculture, particularly in areas affected by food
deserts (communities with limited access to fresh produce).
Using Arduino hardware and MATLAB software, your team will:
• Read data from environmental sensors (e.g. temperature, humidity).
• Display real-time data in a MATLAB live script.
• Trigger actuators (e.g., fans, lights) based on sensor thresholds.
